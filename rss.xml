            <description><![CDATA[<p>UX Demand is rapidly growing. Although the term “User Experience” has been used already in the ‘90s by Donald Norman it is still a young field in design, which many people have a problem identifying what it really does. UX Monkey writes about prototyping tools for UX designers and today we would like to share some sites, books and other resources for you to get to know User Experience a bit more. If you want to know what UX is all about and how to design perfect apps, sites and interactive products matching expectation of the user — this post is a good start. Dig in and start learning!</p>]]></description>
